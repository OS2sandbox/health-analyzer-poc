# üöÄ Health Analyzer PoC
> Reducing Risk in Open Source Adoption

## üß≠ Purpose
_The health-analyzer-poc is a **proof-of-concept** for evaluating the **health, sustainability, and reusability** of software projects hosted in Git repositories._
_The goal is to provide **data-driven insights** for stakeholders such as maintainers, contributors, and decision-makers._

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The analyzer can be built to support two seperate operational modes:

### 1. **Full-Stack Mode**
- Leverages selected [CHAOSS metrics](https://chaoss.community/kbtopic/all-metricsa) and [8knot](https://eightknot.osci.io/chaoss) for **continuous monitoring** of repositories.
- Traditional "Dashboarding" approach with persistent database backend.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires a larger infrastructure setup (e.g., persistent storage, dashboard hosting) and cost.

### 2. **Ephemeral Mode**
- Runs as a **containerized job** (e.g., via GitHub Actions or CI/CD pipelines).
- Pulls data from the **Forge (e.g. github API) API** and generates a **report** (Markdown or HTML).
- Ideal for **on-demand evaluations** with **zero infrastructure overhead**.
- Cold be built to be interoperable with [OpenCode Badges](https://opencode.de/de/software/badge-api-4058)
  
## üì¶ Outputs
- **Health Reports**: Markdown/HTML summaries of key metrics.
- **Badges**: Optional visual indicators for embedding in READMEs in forges.
- **Dashboards**: (Full-stack mode only) Interactive views of project trends.
- **Search and rating** of software solutions across forges.
